{ "abort_key", DT_STRING, "\007" },
/*
** .pp
** Specifies the key that can be used to abort prompts.  The format is the
** same as used in "bind" commands.  The default is equivalent to "Ctrl-G".
** Note that the specified key should not be used in other bindings, as the
** abort operation has higher precedence and the binding will not have the
** desired effect.
** .pp
** Example:
** .ex
** set abort_key = "<Esc>"
** .ee
** .pp
** Please note that when using <Esc> as the abort key, you may also want to
** set the environment variable ESCDELAY to a low value or even 0 which will
** reduce the time that ncurses waits to distinguish singular <Esc> key
** presses from the start of a terminal escape sequence. The default time is
** 1000 milliseconds and thus quite noticeable.
