** .pp
** This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
** schemes for messages without character encoding indication.
** Header field values and message body content without character encoding
** indication would be assumed that they are written in one of this list.
** By default, all the header fields and message body without any charset
** indication are assumed to be in "us-ascii".
** .pp
** For example, Japanese users might prefer this:
** .ex
** set assumed_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
** .ee
** .pp
** However, only the first content is valid for the message body.
