** .pp
** This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
** schemes for text file attachments. NeoMutt uses this setting to guess
** which encoding files being attached are encoded in to convert them to
** a proper character set given in $$send_charset.
** .pp
** If \fIunset\fP, the value of $$charset will be used instead.
** For example, the following configuration would work for Japanese
** text handling:
** .ex
** set attach_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
** .ee
** .pp
** Note: for Japanese users, "iso-2022-*" must be put at the head
** of the value as shown above if included.
