** .pp
** The locale used by \fCstrftime(3)\fP to format dates in the
** $attribution string.  Legal values are the strings your system
** accepts for the locale environment variable \fC$$$LC_TIME\fP.
** .pp
** This variable is to allow the attribution date format to be
** customized by recipient or folder using hooks.  By default, NeoMutt
** will use your locale environment, so there is no need to set
** this except to override that default.
