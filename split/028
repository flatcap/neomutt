** send-menu (prompting for subject and recipients) and allow you to
** immediately begin editing the body of your

** editing the body of your message.
** .pp
** \fBNote:\fP when this option is \fIset\fP, you can't use send-hooks that depend
** on the recipients when composing a new (non-reply) message, as the initial
** list of recipients is empty.
