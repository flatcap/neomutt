/*
** .pp
** When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will abbreviate mailbox
** names in the browser mailbox list, using '~' and '='
** shortcuts.
** .pp
** The default \fC"alpha"\fP setting of $$sort_browser uses
** locale-based sorting (using \fCstrcoll(3)\fP), which ignores some
** punctuation.  This can lead to some situations where the order
** doesn't make intuitive sense.  In those cases, it may be
** desirable to \fIunset\fP this variable.
