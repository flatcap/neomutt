** .pp
** This variable specifies the file where the certificates you trust
** are saved. When an unknown certificate is encountered, you are asked
** if you accept it or not. If you accept it, the certificate can also
** be saved in this file and further connections are automatically
** accepted.

** You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server
** certificate that is signed with one of these CA certificates is
** also automatically accepted.

** Example:
** .ex
