/*
** .pp
** When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use file size attribute instead of
** access time when checking for new mail in mbox and mmdf folders.
** .pp
** This variable is \fIunset\fP by default and should only be enabled when
** new mail detection for these folder types is unreliable or doesn't work.
** .pp
** Note that enabling this variable should happen before any "$mailboxes"
** directives occur in configuration files regarding mbox or mmdf folders
** because NeoMutt needs to determine the initial new mail status of such a
** mailbox by performing a fast mailbox scan when it is defined.
** Afterwards the new mail status is tracked by file size changes.
