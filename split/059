** performing attachment searching and counting(see $attachments).
** .pp
** Traditionally, multipart/alternative parts have simply represented
** different encodings of the main content of the email.  Unfortunately,
** some mail clients have started to place email attachments inside
** one of alternatives.  Setting this will allow NeoMutt to find
** and count matching attachments hidden there, and include them
** in the index via %X or through ~X pattern matching.
