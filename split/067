{ "crypt_opportunistic_encrypt_strong_keys", DT_BOOL, false },
/*
** .pp
** When set, this modifies the behavior of $$crypt_opportunistic_encrypt
** to only search for "strong keys", that is, keys with full validity
** according to the web-of-trust algorithm.  A key with marginal or no
** validity will not enable opportunistic encryption.
** .pp
** For S/MIME, the behavior depends on the backend.  Classic S/MIME will
** filter for certificates with the 't'(trusted) flag in the .index file.
** The GPGME backend will use the same filters as with OpenPGP, and depends
** on GPGME's logic for assigning the GPGME_VALIDITY_FULL and
** GPGME_VALIDITY_ULTIMATE validity flag.
