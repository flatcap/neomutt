** Encrypted messages using protected headers often substitute the exposed
** Subject header with a dummy value (see $$crypt_protected_headers_subject).
** NeoMutt will update its concept of the correct subject \fBafter\fP the
** message is opened, i.e. via the \fC<display-message>\fP function.
** If you reply to a message before opening it, NeoMutt will end up using
** the dummy Subject header, so be sure to open such a message first.
