** .pp
** This variable controls the use of the GPGME-enabled crypto backends.
** If it is \fIset\fP and NeoMutt was built with GPGME support, the gpgme code for
** S/MIME and PGP will be used instead of the classic code.  Note that
** you need to set this option in .neomuttrc; it won't have any effect when
** used interactively.
** .pp
** Note that the GPGME backend does not support creating old-style inline
** (traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages (see $$pgp_auto_inline).
