** \fC$$debug_file\fP specifies the root of the filename.  NeoMutt will add "0" to the end.
** Each time NeoMutt is run with logging enabled, the log files are rotated.
** A maximum of five log files are kept, numbered 0 (most recent) to 4 (oldest).
** .pp
** This option can be enabled on the command line, "neomutt -l mylog"
