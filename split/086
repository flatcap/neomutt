{ "display_filter", DT_COMMAND, 0 },
/*
** .pp
** When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message
** is viewed it is passed as standard input to $$display_filter, and the
** filtered message is read from the standard output.
** .pp
** When preparing the message, NeoMutt inserts some escape sequences into the
** text.  They are of the form: \fC<esc>]9;XXX<bel>\fP where "XXX" is a random
** 64-bit number.
** .pp
** If these escape sequences interfere with your filter, they can be removed
** using a tool like \fCansifilter\fP or \fCsed 's/^\x1b]9;[0-9]\+\x7//'\fP
** .pp
** If they are removed, then PGP and MIME headers will no longer be coloured.
** This can be fixed by adding this to your config:
** \fCcolor body magenta default '^\[-- .* --\]$$$'\fP.
