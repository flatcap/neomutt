** .pp
** This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The
** string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more
** of the following: \fInever\fP, to never request notification,
** \fIfailure\fP, to request notification on transmission failure,
** \fIdelay\fP, to be notified of message delays, \fIsuccess\fP, to be
** notified of successful transmission.
** .pp
** Example:
** .ex
** set dsn_notify="failure,delay"
** .ee
** .pp
** \fBNote:\fP when using $$sendmail for delivery, you should not enable
** this unless you are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a MTA
** providing a \fCsendmail(1)\fP-compatible interface supporting the \fC-N\fP option
** for DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it
** depends on the server whether DSN will be used or not.
