{ "editor", DT_COMMAND, 0 },
/*
** .pp
** This variable specifies which editor is used by NeoMutt.
** It defaults to the value of the \fC$$$VISUAL\fP, or \fC$$$EDITOR\fP, environment
** variable, or to the string "vi" if neither of those are set.
** .pp
** The \fC$$editor\fP string may contain a \fI%s\fP escape, which will be replaced by the name
** of the file to be edited.  If the \fI%s\fP escape does not appear in \fC$$editor\fP, a
** space and the name to be edited are appended.
** .pp
** The resulting string is then executed by running
** .ex
** sh -c 'string'
** .ee
** .pp
** where \fIstring\fP is the expansion of \fC$$editor\fP described above.
