** If this is empty or unset (default), the traditional long "To ",
** "Cc " and "Bcc " prefixes are used.  If set but too short to
** include a character for a particular case, a single space will be
** prepended to the field.  To prevent any prefix at all from being
** added in a particular case, use the special value CR (aka ^M)
** for the corresponding character.

** This slightly odd interface is necessitated by NeoMutt's handling of
** string variables; one can't tell a variable that is unset from one
** that is set to the empty string.
