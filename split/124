/*
** .pp
** This variable points to the header cache database. If the path points to
** an existing directory, NeoMutt will create a dedicated header cache
** database per folder. Otherwise, the path points to a regular file, which
** will be created as needed and used as a shared global header cache for
** all folders.
** By default it is \fIunset\fP so no header caching will be used.
** .pp
** Header caching can greatly improve speed when opening POP, IMAP
** MH or Maildir folders, see "$caching" in the NeoMutt Guide for details.
