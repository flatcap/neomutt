/*
** .pp
** This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of
** the string history buffer per category. The buffer is cleared each time the
** variable is set.
** .pp
** Note that strings (e.g. commands) starting with a space are never recorded
** in the history.  This is for example useful to prevent leaking sensitive
** information into the history file or for one off tests.
** .pp
** Also note that a string is not added to the history if it exactly matches
** its immediate predecessor, e.g. executing the same command twice in a row
** results in only one copy being added to the history.  To prevent duplicates
** over all entries use $$history_remove_dups.
