** When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the CONDSTORE extension (RFC7162)
** if advertised by the server.  NeoMutt's current implementation is basic,
** used only for initial message fetching and flag updates.
** .pp
** For some IMAP servers, enabling this will slightly speed up
** downloading initial messages.  Unfortunately, Gmail is not one
** those, and displays worse performance when enabled.  Your
** mileage may vary.
