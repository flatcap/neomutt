** .pp
** When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will periodically calculate message
** statistics of a mailbox while polling for new mail.  It will
** check for unread, flagged, and total message counts.  Because
** this operation is more performance intensive, it defaults to
** \fIunset\fP, and has a separate option, $$mail_check_stats_interval, to
** control how often to update these counts.
** .pp
** Message statistics can also be explicitly calculated by invoking the
** \fC<check-stats>\fP function.
