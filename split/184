** a maildir folder for new messages.  This might be useful if other
** programs interacting with the folder (e.g. dovecot) are moving new
** messages to the cur directory.  Note that setting this option may
** slow down polling for new messages in large folders, since NeoMutt has
** to scan all cur messages.
