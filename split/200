** set as if the user had pressed the Esc key and whatever key remains
** after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
** has an ASCII value of \fC0xf8\fP, then this is treated as if the user had

** high bit from \fC0xf8\fP is \fC0x78\fP, which is the ASCII character
** "x".
