** When \fIset\fP, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
** separate \fCmessage/rfc822\fP MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
** message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
** can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
** to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
** variable to "ask-no" or "ask-yes".
