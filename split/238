** .pp
** This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods NeoMutt may
** attempt to use to log in to a news server, in the order NeoMutt should
** try them.  Authentication methods are either "user" or any
** SASL mechanism, e.g. "digest-md5", "gssapi" or "cram-md5".
** This option is case-insensitive.  If it's \fIunset\fP (the default)
** NeoMutt will try all available methods, in order from most-secure to
** least-secure.
** .pp
** Example:
** .ex
** set nntp_authenticators="digest-md5:user"
** .ee
** .pp
** \fBNote:\fP NeoMutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
** the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
** authentication fails, NeoMutt will not connect to the IMAP server.
