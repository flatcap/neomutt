/*
** .pp
** Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
** the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
** folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
** giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
** message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
** remain to be read in the current thread.  A value of 0 results in no index
** being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder is less than
** $$pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as many lines as it needs.
