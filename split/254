/*
** .pp
** This option controls whether NeoMutt generates old-style inline
** (traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages under certain
** circumstances.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp menu,
** when inline is not required.  The GPGME backend does not support
** this option.
** .pp
** Note that NeoMutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages
** which consist of more than a single MIME part.  NeoMutt can be
** configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
** (traditional) would not work.
** .pp
** Also see the $$pgp_mime_auto variable.
** .pp
** Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is \fBstrongly\fP
** \fBdeprecated\fP.
