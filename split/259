/*
** .pp
** This command is used to decrypt a PGP encrypted message.
** .pp
** This is a format string, see the $$pgp_decode_command command for
** possible \fCprintf(3)\fP-like sequences.
** (PGP only)
** .pp
** Note: When decrypting messages using \fCgpg\fP, a pinentry program needs to
** be invoked unless the password is cached within \fCgpg-agent\fP.
** Currently, the \fCpinentry-tty\fP program (usually distributed with
** \fCgpg\fP) isn't suitable for being invoked by NeoMutt.  You are encouraged
** to use a different pinentry-program when running NeoMutt in order to avoid
** problems.
