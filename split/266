** This command is invoked whenever NeoMutt needs to fetch the public key associated with
** an email address.  Of the sequences supported by $$pgp_decode_command, %r is
** the only \fCprintf(3)\fP-like sequence used with this format.  Note that
** in this case, %r expands to the email address, not the public key ID (the key ID is
** unknown, which is why NeoMutt is invoking this command).
