/*
** .pp
** This command is used to list the secret key ring's contents.  The
** output format must be analogous to the one used by:
** .ex
** gpg --list-keys --with-colons --with-fingerprint
** .ee
** .pp
** Note: gpg's \fCfixed-list-mode\fP option should not be used.  It
** produces a different date format which may result in NeoMutt showing
** incorrect key generation dates.
** .pp
** This is a format string, see the $$pgp_decode_command command for
** possible \fCprintf(3)\fP-like sequences.
** (PGP only)
