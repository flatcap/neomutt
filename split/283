/*
** .pp
** If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt expects a \fCgpg-agent(1)\fP process will handle
** private key passphrase prompts.  If \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will prompt
** for the passphrase and pass it via stdin to the pgp command.
** .pp
** Note that as of version 2.1, GnuPG automatically spawns an agent
** and requires the agent be used for passphrase management.  Since
** that version is increasingly prevalent, this variable now
** defaults \fIset\fP.
** .pp
** NeoMutt works with a GUI or curses pinentry program.  A TTY pinentry
** should not be used.
** .pp
** If you are using an older version of GnuPG without an agent running,
** or another encryption program without an agent, you will need to
** \fIunset\fP this variable.
