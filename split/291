** This is a colon-separated list of authentication methods NeoMutt may
** attempt to use to log in to an POP server, in the order NeoMutt should
** try them.  Authentication methods are either "user", "apop" or any
** SASL mechanism, e.g. "digest-md5", "gssapi" or "cram-md5".
** This option is case-insensitive. If this option is \fIunset\fP
** (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods, in order from
** most-secure to least-secure.

** .ex
** set pop_authenticators="digest-md5:apop:user"
