** .pp
** If \fIset\fP, a shell command to be executed if NeoMutt fails to establish
** a connection to the server. This is useful for setting up secure
** connections, e.g. with \fCssh(1)\fP. If the command returns a  nonzero
** status, NeoMutt gives up opening the server. Example:
** .ex
** set preconnect="ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net sleep 20 < /dev/null > /dev/null"
** .ee
** .pp
** Mailbox "foo" on "mailhost.net" can now be reached
** as "{localhost:1234}foo".
** .pp
** Note: For this example to work, you must be able to log in to the
** remote machine without having to enter a password.
