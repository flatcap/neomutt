** .pp
** Used in connection with the \fC<print-message>\fP function.  If this
** option is \fIset\fP, the message is decoded before it is passed to the
** external command specified by $$print_command.  If this option
** is \fIunset\fP, no processing will be applied to the message when
** printing it.  The latter setting may be useful if you are using
** some advanced printer filter which is able to properly format
** e-mail messages for printing.
** .pp
** Also see $$print_decode_weed, which controls whether headers will
** be weeded when this is \fIset\fP.
