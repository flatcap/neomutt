** .pp
** This variable controls whether "quit" and "exit" actually quit
** from NeoMutt.  If this option is \fIset\fP, they do quit, if it is \fIunset\fP, they
** have no effect, and if it is set to \fIask-yes\fP or \fIask-no\fP, you are
** prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.
** .pp
** In order to quit from NeoMutt if this variable is \fIunset\fP, you must send
** the signal SIGINT to NeoMutt.  This can usually be achieved by pressing
** CTRL-C in the terminal.
