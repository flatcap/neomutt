/*
** .pp
** A regular expression used in the internal pager to determine quoted
** sections of text in the body of a message. Quoted text may be filtered
** out using the \fC<toggle-quoted>\fP command, or colored according to the
** "color quoted" family of directives.
** .pp
** Higher levels of quoting may be colored differently ("color quoted1",
** "color quoted2", etc.). The quoting level is determined by removing
** the last character from the matched text and recursively reapplying
** the regular expression until it fails to produce a match.
** .pp
** Match detection may be overridden by the $$smileys regular expression.
