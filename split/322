** .pp
** This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be
** appended.  (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of
** your messages, but another way to do this is using the "$my_hdr"
** command to create a "Bcc:" field with your email address in it.)
** .pp
** The value of \fI$$record\fP is overridden by the $$force_name and
** $$save_name variables, and the "$fcc-hook" command.  Also see $$copy
