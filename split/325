{ "reflow_wrap", DT_NUMBER, 78 },
/*
** .pp
** This variable controls the maximum paragraph width when reformatting text/plain
** parts when $$reflow_text is \fIset\fP.  When the value is 0, paragraphs will
** be wrapped at the terminal's right margin.  A positive value sets the
** paragraph width relative to the left margin.  A negative value set the
** paragraph width relative to the right margin.
** .pp
** Be aware that the reformatted lines of a paragraph are still subject to $$wrap.
** This means if $$reflow_wrap is 40 and $$wrap is 30, then the paragraph gets
** reformatted to 40 characters a line (due to $$reflow_wrap) and afterwards
** each 40-character-line is split at 30 characters (due to $$wrap), resulting in
** alternating line lengths of 30 and 10 characters.
** .pp
** Also see $$wrap.
