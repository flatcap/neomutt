** If \fIset\fP, draft files previously edited (via \fC-E -H\fP on
** the command line) will have $$resume_draft_files automatically
** set when they are used as a draft file again.
** .pp
** The first time a draft file is saved, NeoMutt will add a header,
** X-Mutt-Resume-Draft to the saved file.  The next time the draft
** file is read in, if NeoMutt sees the header, it will set
** $$resume_draft_files.
** .pp
** This option is designed to prevent multiple signatures,
** user-defined headers, and other processing effects from being
** made multiple times to the draft file.
