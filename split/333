{ "reverse_alias", DT_BOOL, false },
/*
** .pp
** This variable controls whether or not NeoMutt will display the "personal"
** name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
** matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
** alias:
** .ex
** alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)
** .ee
** .pp
** and then you receive mail which contains the following header:
** .ex
** From: abd30425@somewhere.net
** .ee
** .pp
** It would be displayed in the index menu as "Joe User" instead of
** "abd30425@somewhere.net."  This is useful when the person's e-mail
** address is not human friendly.
