/*
** .pp
** This variable fine-tunes the behavior of the $$reverse_name feature.
** .pp
** When it is \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will remove the real name part of a
** matching address.  This allows the use of the email address
** without having to also use what the sender put in the real name
** field.
** .pp
** When it is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the matching address as-is.
** .pp
** In either case, a missing real name will be filled in afterwards
** using the value of $$real_name.
