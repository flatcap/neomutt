** .pp
** When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will decode RFC2047-encoded MIME
** parameters. You want to set this variable when NeoMutt suggests you
** to save attachments to files named like:
** .ex
** =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
** =?utf-8?Q?z=C4=99ta.png?=
** .ee
** .pp
** When this variable is \fIset\fP interactively, the change won't be
** active until you change folders.
** .pp
** Note that this use of RFC2047's encoding is explicitly
** prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
** wild and produced by, e.g., Outlook.
** .pp
** Also note that setting this parameter will \fInot\fP have the effect
** that NeoMutt \fIgenerates\fP this kind of encoding.  Instead, NeoMutt will
** unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC2231.
