** Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by NeoMutt.
** NeoMutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
** arguments as recipient addresses.  NeoMutt appends all recipients after
** adding a \fC--\fP delimiter (if not already present).  Additional
** flags, such as for $$use_8bit_mime, $$use_envelope_from,
** $$dsn_notify, or $$dsn_return will be added before the delimiter.
