** The default behavior of NeoMutt is to use PGP on all auto-sign/encryption
** operations. To override and to use OpenSSL instead this must be \fIset\fP.
** However, this has no effect while replying, since NeoMutt will automatically
** select the same application that was used to sign/encrypt the original
** message.  (Note that this variable can be overridden by unsetting $$crypt_auto_smime.)
