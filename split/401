** .pp
** This is a colon-separated list of authentication methods NeoMutt may
** attempt to use to log in to an SMTP server, in the order NeoMutt should
** try them.  Authentication methods are any SASL mechanism, e.g. "plain",
** "digest-md5", "gssapi" or "cram-md5".
** This option is case-insensitive. If it is "unset"
** (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods, in order from
** most-secure to least-secure. Support for the "plain" mechanism is
** bundled; other mechanisms are provided by an external SASL library (look
** for '+sasl' in the output of neomutt -v).
** .pp
** Example:
** .ex
** set smtp_authenticators="digest-md5:cram-md5"
** .ee
