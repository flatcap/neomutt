** .pp
** Specifies how to sort messages in the "index" menu.  Valid values
** are:
** .ts
** .td \fBSort\fP    .td \fBDescription\fP
** .td date          .td Sort by the date the email was sent
** .td date-sent     .td Sort by the date the email was sent
** .td date-received .td Sort by when the message were delivered locally
** .td from          .td Sort by the email's From field
** .td label         .td Sort by the emails label
** .td unsorted      .td Sort by the order the messages appear in the mailbox
** .td score         .td Sort by the email's score
** .td size          .td Sort by the size of the email
** .td spam          .td Sort by the email's spam score
** .td subject       .td Sort by the email's subject
** .td threads       .td Sort by email threads
** .td to            .td Sort by the email's To field

** .pp
** You may optionally use the "reverse-" prefix to specify reverse
** sorting order, or the "last-" prefix to sort threads based on the
** corresponding attribute of the last descendant rather than the
** thread root.  If both prefixes are in use, "reverse-" must come
** before "last-".  The "last-" prefix has no effect on a flat view.
** .pp
** Any ties in the primary sort are broken by $$sort_aux.  When
** $$use_threads is "threads" or "reverse", $$sort controls the
** sorting between threads, and $$sort_aux controls the sorting within
** a thread.
** .pp
** The "date-sent" value is a synonym for "date". The "mailbox-order" value is
** a synonym for "unsorted".
** .pp
** The values of "threads" and "reverse-threads" are legacy options,
** which cause the value of \fC$$sort_aux\fP to also contol sorting
** between threads, and they may not be used with the "last-" prefix.
** The preferred way to enable a threaded view is via
** \fC$$use_threads\fP.  This variable can also be set via the
** \fC<sort-mailbox>\fP and \fC<sort-reverse>\fP functions.
** .pp
** Note: When $$use_threads is "threads", the last thread sorts to the
** bottom; when it is "reversed", the last thread sorts to the top.
** The use of "reverse-" in $$sort swaps which end the last thread
** will sort to.
** .pp

** examples, https://neomutt.org/feature/use-threads
