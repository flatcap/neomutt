{ "sort_aux", DT_SORT, SORT_DATE },
/*
** .pp
** This provides a secondary sort for messages in the "index" menu, used
** when the $$sort value is equal for two messages.
** .pp
** When sorting by threads, this variable controls how subthreads are
** sorted within a single thread (for the order between threads, see
** $$sort).  This can be set to any value that $$sort can, including
** with the use of "reverse-" and "last-" prefixes, except for
** variations using "threads" (in that case, NeoMutt will just use
** "date").  For instance,
** .ex
** set sort_aux=last-date-received
** .ee
** .pp
** would mean that if a new message is received in a thread, that
** subthread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if you have
** "\fCset use_threads=reverse\fP".)  When using $$use_threads, it is
** more common to use "last-" with $$sort and not with $$sort_aux.
** .pp
** See the "Use Threads Feature" section for further explanation and
** examples, https://neomutt.org/feature/use-threads
