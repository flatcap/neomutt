** This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with
** $$strict_threads \fIunset\fP.  In that case, it changes the heuristic
** mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With $$sort_re \fIset\fP, mutt will
** only attach a message as the child of another message by subject if
** the subject of the child message starts with a substring matching the
** setting of $$reply_regex.  With $$sort_re \fIunset\fP, mutt will attach
** the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
** non-$$reply_regex parts of both messages are identical.
