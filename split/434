/*
** .pp
** When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will generate "format=flowed" bodies with a content type
** of "\fCtext/plain; format=flowed\fP".
** This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
** just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's
** features, you'll need support in your editor.
** .pp
** The option only controls newly composed messages.  Postponed messages,
** resent messages, and draft messages (via -H on the command line) will
** use the content-type of the source message.
** .pp
** Note that $$indent_string is ignored when this option is \fIset\fP.
