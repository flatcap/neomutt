** .pp
** Affects the \fC~b\fP, \fC~B\fP, and \fC~h\fP search operations described in
** section "$patterns".  If \fIset\fP, the headers and body/attachments of
** messages to be searched are decoded before searching. If \fIunset\fP,
** messages are searched as they appear in the folder.
** .pp
** Users searching attachments or for non-ASCII characters should \fIset\fP
** this value because decoding also includes MIME parsing/decoding and possible
** character set conversions. Otherwise NeoMutt will attempt to match against the
** raw message received (for example quoted-printable encoded or with encoded
** headers) which may lead to incorrect search results.
