** .pp
** If $$strict_threads is \fIunset\fP, then messages may also be grouped by
** subject.  Unlike threading by "In-Reply-To:" and "References:" header,
** grouping by subject does not imply a parent-child relation between two
** messages.
** .pp
** To determine the ancestry between messages grouped by subject, Neomutt uses
** their date: only newer messages can be descendants of older ones.
** .pp
** When $$thread_received is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt uses the date received rather
** than the date sent when comparing messages for the date.

** See also $$strict_threads, and $$sort_re.
