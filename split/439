** .pp
** When NeoMutt is waiting for user input either idling in menus or
** in an interactive prompt, NeoMutt would block until input is
** present. Depending on the context, this would prevent certain
** operations from working, like checking for new mail or keeping
** an IMAP connection alive.
** .pp
** This variable controls how many seconds NeoMutt will at most wait
** until it aborts waiting for input, performs these operations and
** continues to wait for input.
** .pp
** A value of zero or less will cause NeoMutt to never time out.
