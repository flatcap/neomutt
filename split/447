{ "tunnel", DT_COMMAND, 0 },
/*
** .pp
** Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to open a pipe to a command
** instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
** preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3/SMTP server. Example:
** .ex
** set tunnel="ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"
** .ee
** .pp
** Note: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
** machine without having to enter a password.
** .pp
** When set, NeoMutt uses the tunnel for all remote connections.
** Please see "$account-hook" in the manual for how to use different
** tunnel commands per connection.
