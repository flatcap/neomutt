** When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will assume the $$tunnel connection does not need
** STARTTLS to be enabled.  It will also allow IMAP PREAUTH server
** responses inside a $tunnel to proceed.  This is appropriate if $$tunnel
** uses ssh or directly invokes the server locally.
** .pp
** When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will negotiate STARTTLS according to the
** $ssl_starttls and $ssl_force_tls variables.  If $ssl_force_tls is
** set, NeoMutt will abort connecting if an IMAP server responds with PREAUTH.
** This setting is appropriate if $$tunnel does not provide security and
** could be tampered with by attackers.
