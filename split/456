/*
** .pp
** The style of threading used in the index. May be one of "flat" (no
** threading), "threads" (threaded, with subthreads below root
** message) or "reverse" (threaded, with subthreads above root
** message). For convenience, the value "yes" is a synonym for
** "threads", and "no" is a synonym for "flat".
** .pp
** If this variable is never set, then \fC$$sort\fP controls whether
** threading is used, \fC$$sort_aux\fP controls both the sorting of
** threads and subthreads, and using \fC<sort-mailbox>\fP to select
** threads affects only \fC$$sort\fP.  Once this variable is set,
** attempting to set \fC$$sort\fP to a value using "threads" will
** warn, the value of \fC$$sort\fP controls the sorting between
** threads while \fC$$sort_aux\fP controls sorting within a thread,
** and \fC<sort-mailbox>\fP toggles \fC$$use_threads\fP.
** .pp
** Example:
** .ex
** set use_threads=yes
** .ee
** .pp
** See the "Use Threads Feature" section for further explanation and
** examples.
