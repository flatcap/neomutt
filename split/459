** .pp
** Controls whether NeoMutt will ask you to press a key after an external command
** has been invoked by these functions: \fC<shell-escape>\fP,
** \fC<pipe-message>\fP, \fC<pipe-entry>\fP, \fC<print-message>\fP,
** and \fC<print-entry>\fP commands.
** .pp
** It is also used when viewing attachments with "$auto_view", provided
** that the corresponding mailcap entry has a \fIneedsterminal\fP flag,
** and the external program is interactive.
** .pp
** When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will always ask for a key. When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will wait
** for a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.
