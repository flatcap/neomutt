{ "write_bcc", DT_BOOL, false },
/*
** .pp
** Controls whether NeoMutt writes out the "Bcc:" header when
** preparing messages to be sent.  Some MTAs, such as Exim and
** Courier, do not strip the "Bcc:" header; so it is advisable to
** leave this unset unless you have a particular need for the header
** to be in the sent message.
** .pp
** If NeoMutt is set to deliver directly via SMTP(see $$smtp_url),
** this option does nothing: NeoMutt will never write out the "Bcc:"
** header in this case.
** .pp
** Note this option only affects the sending of messages.  Fcc'ed
** copies of a message will always contain the "Bcc:" header if
** one exists.
